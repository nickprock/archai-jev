"""006 - Async: keep your program responsive while the model decides.

What you will learn
-------------------
* ``ask_many``: the same question about MANY texts in one call,
* ``aask`` / ``aask_many``: the ``async`` versions, for ``asyncio`` programs,
* how to prove that the event loop is not blocked while the model works,
* that one ``Jev`` handles ONE request at a time: concurrent calls wait their turn.

The use case
------------
Customer messages arrive in a stream. For each one we want to know "does this customer want
to cancel their subscription?" (so we can send it to the retention team). The question is
always the same, only the text changes: exactly what ``ask_many`` is for.

(Trick worth noticing: we use the ``entailment`` task as a flexible yes/no classifier. The
message is the premise and the question is the statement we want to test. You are not
limited to the four sentences of the training set: ANY statement can be the hypothesis.)

Run it
