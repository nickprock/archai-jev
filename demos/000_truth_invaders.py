"""Truth Invaders: a retro arcade game played by a language model, in real time.

What you are looking at
-----------------------
A *briefing* (a short fact) is shown at the top of the screen. Then *claims* fall from
the sky like space invaders. Some claims are supported by the briefing, some are
contradicted by it. The cannon at the bottom is driven by the model:

* the model says the claim is TRUE  -> it lets the invader land (it is a friend),
* the model says the claim is FALSE -> the cannon locks on and shoots it down.

Every wrong call costs a base block: a lie that lands (BREACH), a truth that gets shot
(FRIENDLY FIRE), or a claim the model did not judge before it touched the ground
(OVERRUN). The waves get faster and faster, so the score is really a measure of how many
decisions per second the model can take. The HUD shows that number live.

How the model is used (the whole point of this demo)
-----------------------------------------------------
Each claim is ONE call to ``Jev.ask``:

    state     = the briefing                  (the premise)
    question  = YesNo(<the claim>, ...)       (the hypothesis)

and the answer is a typed value with a probability: ``answer.probability`` is P(yes).
There is no text generation and no parsing of free text anywhere in this file.

Honest limits (please read before recording a video)
-----------------------------------------------------
* ``Jev.from_pretrained()`` loads a small DEMO model that answers exactly four fixed
  tasks. We use the ``entailment`` one. Any other question raises
  ``UnsupportedRequestError``: this is a deliberate safety feature of the library.
* The model is overconfident outside its training distribution and it can be wrong.
  The game shows its accuracy on the game over screen, mistakes included.
* Speed numbers on screen are measured on YOUR machine, live. Nothing here is a claim.

Run it
------
    python demos/000_truth_invaders.py                # play (first run downloads ~1.6 GB)
    python demos/000_truth_invaders.py --autostart    # skip the title screen
    python demos/000_truth_invaders.py --headless     # no window: measure accuracy/latency

Other options: ``--speed 1.5`` (harder), ``--seed N``, ``--max-seconds N`` (quit by
itself), ``--threads N`` (CPU threads for the model: by default the game leaves a few
cores to the window, see ``configure_threads``).
Keys: SPACE = start / play again, ESC = quit.
