"""004 - "Never wrong probabilities": the errors archai-jev raises ON PURPOSE.

What you will learn
-------------------
* the principle: if the library cannot guarantee that a probability really is the
  model's own, it RAISES an error instead of returning a number,
* every kind of error you can meet, with an example that provokes it,
* how to catch them: one base class (``JevError``) and specific subclasses,
* that there is no switch to turn the checks off.

Why this matters
----------------
A wrong probability returned silently is the worst failure of a decision model: your
program trusts it and acts on it. So the library prefers to stop. Prompts that are too
long are refused (never truncated), questions the model was not trained for are refused
(never "adapted"), and a model that does not pass its self-check does not load.

Run it
------
    python demos/004_never_wrong_probabilities.py

The first two parts need no model at all and finish instantly. The third part loads the
default model (about 1.6 GB, downloaded once).
