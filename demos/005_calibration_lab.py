"""005 - Calibration lab: what does the "temperature" do to a probability?

What you will learn
-------------------
* what calibration means: when a model says "90% sure", it should be right about 90% of
  the time,
* how ``temperature`` reshapes the probabilities WITHOUT changing the decisions,
* how to load a model with the temperature declared by its author or with your own
  (``Jev.from_pretrained(temperature=...)``),
* how to measure confidence against accuracy on a small labelled set.

The idea
--------
A language model produces raw scores called *logits*. Turning them into probabilities with
a plain softmax often gives numbers that are too extreme: the model says 99% and is right
80% of the time (it is *overconfident*). Dividing the logits by a number T > 1 before the
softmax flattens the distribution. T is the *temperature*. It never changes which answer
is the most probable, only how sure the model sounds.

Run it
------
    python demos/005_calibration_lab.py

It loads the default model three times (about 1.6 GB each time, from the local cache),
so expect a short wait at the start of each step.

A word of caution
-----------------
The numbers below come from only 36 hand-written claims. They illustrate the method, they
do not certify anything. The author of the default model measured its temperature on data
from the model's own training distribution; on other data the model can still be too sure.
