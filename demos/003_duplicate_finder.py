"""003 - Duplicate finder: group support tickets that say the same thing.

What you will learn
-------------------
* how to use the ``similarity`` task to compare two texts,
* how to turn pairwise probabilities into groups (a tiny clustering),
* why comparing every pair is expensive (the cost grows with the SQUARE of the list),
* that similarity answers are not perfectly symmetric.

The use case
------------
A bug tracker receives tickets written by different people about the same problem.
Finding duplicates by hand is boring; finding them by keywords misses "dark mode" vs "night
theme". A decision model can read two titles and say whether they mean the same.

Run it
------
    python demos/003_duplicate_finder.py

It asks about every pair of the 12 tickets below: 66 questions. It prints the time it took
on YOUR machine; nothing in this file claims a speed.
