"""002 - Grounding check: is each sentence of an answer supported by the source?

What you will learn
-------------------
* how to use the ``entailment`` task as a *fact checker* for generated text,
* how to ask MANY questions about ONE state in a single ``ask`` call,
* how to turn a probability into a decision, and why the threshold is yours to choose,
* what a YesNo answer can and cannot tell you.

The use case
------------
Imagine an assistant that answers questions about a document (a "RAG" system). Language
models sometimes add details that are not in the document. A cheap, fast check: split the
answer into sentences and ask a decision model whether each sentence is *supported by the
source*. Sentences that are not supported are the ones to review or to remove.

Run it
------
    python demos/002_grounding_check.py

The default model reads at most 512 tokens per question (roughly 350 words), including the
source. A longer document must be split in chunks first: the library refuses to truncate
text silently (demo 004 shows the error).

    # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # What a YesNo answer cannot tell you.
    #
    # There are only two outcomes. A sentence that CONTRADICTS the source and a sentence
    # that simply is not MENTIONED in it both get a low P(supported): the model does not
    # separate them. For a fact checker that is usually what you want (both are
    # "unsupported"), but do not read "low" as "false".
    #
    # Remember also that this is a small demo model: it is overconfident outside the data
    # it was trained on, and these ten sentences are an easy, hand-made test. Treat the
    # output as a first filter that points a human at the doubtful sentences.
