//! Decision heads (D16, spec 006b section 8): what turns what the model emits into **one raw
//! logit per option**. The engine knows nothing about a head's type: it runs the outputs the head
//! asks for. Kev's pointer head reads hidden states; the letters head of 006c reads logits.
//!
//! Heads return **raw** logits. The temperature is applied by `ask` through the calibration the
//! model was loaded with, in one place.
