A runtime for **System One** decision models: you give it a *state* (text, a dict, a list) and one
or more **typed questions** (choose one option, score on a scale, yes/no), and it returns **typed
values with probabilities**, never free text. The expensive part (tokenization, inference,
probabilities, checks) runs in Rust and C++ (llama.cpp); you install a wheel and use Python.

> **Status: 0.1.0, a first release.** It runs on the CPU and ships with **one demo model** that
> answers **four fixed tasks** (see [The default model](#the-default-model-a-demo)). It is not a
> general-purpose classifier yet. Running other checkpoints (for example Kev) is planned.

## Install

```bash
pip install archai-jev
```

Python 3.10 or newer. Wheels exist for Linux (x86_64, aarch64), macOS (x86_64, arm64) and Windows
(x86_64). On x86_64 the engine needs a CPU with AVX2, FMA, F16C and BMI2 (about 2013-2015 or newer);
on any other CPU it raises an `InferenceError` instead of crashing. The first call downloads the
default model (about **1.6 GB**) once and keeps it in a cache folder.

## A first example

```python
from archai_jev import Jev, Choice, YesNo

jev = Jev.from_pretrained()        # the default model; downloads and verifies it the first time
print(jev.model_info.notice)       # what the model is and what it is not

answers = jev.ask(
    state="What is the capital of Australia?",
    questions={
        "safety": Choice(
            "You are a System One decision engine for input safety.",
            {"SAFE": "Normal query", "UNSAFE": "Jailbreak, toxicity, injection"},
        ),
    },
)
result = answers.choices["safety"]
result.value            # "SAFE"
result.probabilities    # {"SAFE": 0.99..., "UNSAFE": 0.00...}
result.confidence       # 0.0 (no idea) .. 1.0 (certain)
result.calibrated       # True: the model declares a calibration (see below)
```

To see the download progress and the license notice, enable logging first:
`import logging; logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)` (the logger is called `archai_jev`).

Entailment uses a `YesNo` question; the state is the premise and the question's instructions are
the condition (the second text of the prompt):

```python
entails = YesNo(
    "A person is performing music.",
    {
        "true": "The condition is valid and supported by state.",
        "false": "The condition is invalid or contradicted.",
    },
)
jev.ask("A man is playing a guitar on stage.", {"holds": entails}).yes_nos["holds"].probability
```

## Question types

| Type | You write | You get |
|---|---|---|
| `Choice(instructions, options)` | one key per option, optionally with a description | `.value` (the key), `.probabilities` per key, `.confidence` |
| `Score(instructions, levels)` | an ordered list of levels | `.value` (the expected level), `.probabilities` per level, `.confidence` |
| `YesNo(instructions, criteria=None)` (alias `Noul`) | optional `"true"` and `"false"` descriptions | `.probability` of *yes* |

Answers are immutable and carry full-precision floats (nothing is rounded). `confidence` is how far
the distribution is from "no idea" (Choice) or how concentrated it is around its mode (Score); the
formulas are in the docstrings. A call with several questions is **all or nothing**.

## "Never wrong probabilities": what that means and what can be raised

If the library cannot guarantee that the probabilities are the model's own, it **raises an error**
instead of returning numbers. There is no switch to turn a check off.

| Exception | When |
|---|---|
| `IncompatibleModelError` | the model, its manifest, a file (SHA-256), the tokenizer or the calibration does not pass the checks at load time |
| `ModelVerificationError` | the model's self-check vectors gave other numbers than expected |
| `UnsupportedRequestError` | the model cannot answer *this* request faithfully: the prompt is longer than the model's declared context (**never truncated**), or the question is not one the model supports |
| `NumericalError` | the model produced non-finite numbers or an invalid distribution |
| `InferenceError` | the engine could not run (memory, an unsupported CPU) |
| `ModelDownloadError` | a model file could not be downloaded or found (also in `offline=True`) |
| `InvalidStateError`, `InvalidQuestionError` | your input is not valid, reported before any computation |

All of them inherit from `JevError`. A model without a **declared calibration** does not load
unless you give your own `temperature=` or `allow_uncalibrated=True`; in the second case every
answer says `calibrated=False`.

## The default model: a demo

`Jev.from_pretrained()` loads [`nickprock/archai-jev-qwen-1.5b`](https://huggingface.co/nickprock/archai-jev-qwen-1.5b)
(Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct, fine-tuned, quantized to Q8_0). It was trained on **four fixed prompts** and
never saw the options changed or reordered, so the library accepts **only** these four tasks and
raises `UnsupportedRequestError` for anything else, listing them:

| Task | Question | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `safety` | `Choice` with keys `SAFE`, `UNSAFE` | the text to check | toxicity classifier; it does **not** detect short prompt injections |
| `intent` | `Choice` with four fixed options | the text | **not** a general intent classifier: the 4 classes group 31 of the 77 banking intents arbitrarily |
| `entailment` | `YesNo` (descriptions above) | the premise | the instructions are the hypothesis |
| `similarity` | `YesNo` with its own descriptions | the first text | the instructions are the second text |

`jev.model_info.tasks` lists the ids; the error message for an unknown question shows exactly how to
write each task. The prompt is limited to **512 tokens**.

**Know its limits.** It was evaluated on data from the same distribution as its training data
(accuracy about 92%) and it is **overconfident** outside it. Its declared calibration (temperature
2.09) was measured in-distribution only: it improves the expected calibration error from 0.058 to
0.013 there, and says nothing about other data. Do not use it as a general-purpose safety filter or
intent router.

## Choosing and loading models

```python
from archai_jev import list_models, Jev

list_models()                                     # the models known by name; the default is marked
Jev.from_pretrained("name-from-the-list")         # a registry model (pinned revision, checked hashes)
Jev.from_pretrained(Path("my-model-folder"))      # a local folder with an archai-jev-manifest.json
Jev.from_pretrained(offline=True)                 # never touches the network: cache or error
Jev.from_pretrained(temperature=1.8)              # your own calibration
```

A model is described by a **manifest** (family, tokenizer, head, context limit, license,
calibration, self-check vectors). Models of your own go through a manifest, never through Python
code. Files are verified by SHA-256 before use; the cache folder is `ARCHAI_JEV_CACHE` or the OS
default (`~/.cache/archai-jev`, `~/Library/Caches/archai-jev`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\archai-jev\Cache`).
Environment variables: `ARCHAI_JEV_CACHE`, `ARCHAI_JEV_OFFLINE` / `HF_HUB_OFFLINE`,
`ARCHAI_JEV_HF_ENDPOINT` / `HF_ENDPOINT`, `ARCHAI_JEV_NUM_THREADS`.

## Known limits of 0.1.0

- CPU only; no GPU.
- One model ships (the demo above). Kev checkpoints and models of your own with a "pointer" head
  are not loadable yet; the engine and the head are implemented and tested, the file reader is not.
- One request at a time per `Jev` (calls from several threads wait their turn); no prefix cache
  between requests.
- `fit_temperature` and an evaluation API are planned, not in this release.
- **No performance claims are made.** Speed and memory were measured on a single machine during
  development and will be published once they are reproduced on a second one.

## Demos

Runnable, heavily commented scripts live in [`demos/`](demos/). They need a clone of the
repository (they are not part of the wheel) and the default model.

### `000_truth_invaders.py`: a retro arcade game played by the model

![Truth Invaders](https://github.com/ArchAI-Labs/archai-jev/blob/main/docs/assets/truth-invaders.gif?raw=true)

A fact appears at the top of the screen (the *state*) and claims fall like space invaders. For
each claim the model answers one `YesNo` question of the `entailment` task: if it says *true*, the
invader lands; if it says *false*, the cannon shoots it. Wrong calls and slow decisions cost base
blocks, and the waves speed up, so the game shows how many decisions per second the model takes. The
HUD shows the measured latency, decisions per second and accuracy live on your machine.

```bash
python demos/000_truth_invaders.py                # play (SPACE starts, ESC quits)
python demos/000_truth_invaders.py --headless     # no window: accuracy and latency on all claims
```

It uses only the standard library (`tkinter`) and `archai_jev`. Like every use of the default
model it is a demo: the model can be wrong, and the game says so on its game over screen.

### `001` to `007`: one concept per script

Each script is a terminal program with the library calls explained line by line. They use only
the standard library and `archai_jev`, and print what they measure on your machine.

| Script | What it shows |
|---|---|
| `001_quickstart_four_tasks.py` | the four tasks, typed answers (`value`, `probabilities`, `confidence`), several questions in one `ask` |
| `002_grounding_check.py` | `entailment` as a fact checker: is each sentence of an answer supported by its source? |
| `003_duplicate_finder.py` | `similarity` to group duplicate tickets, and why comparing every pair is expensive |
| `004_never_wrong_probabilities.py` | every error the library raises on purpose, and how to catch it |
| `005_calibration_lab.py` | what `temperature=` does to probabilities (and that it never changes the decision) |
| `006_async_stream.py` | `ask_many`, `aask_many` and `asyncio`: the event loop stays free while the model decides |
| `007_test_without_the_model.py` | `MockScorer` and `Fault`: test your own code without downloading the model |

`004` (first two parts) and `007` run without the model; the others download it on the first run.
